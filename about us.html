        Many book readers have a tough time looking up their favorite books online. Their details, authors and summaries are pretty hard to
        come by unless you have the book in your hands,thus making it hard for them to judge the book. We aim to solve that problem with our website.

        Our website's goal is to be "THE" place for book hunting. The latest releases and hot sellers will be constantly updated by us 
        to keep the users informed of the trends in the book world. In case a user isn't able to find they're looking for, they are encouraged 
        to place requests to have that particular book added to our database. In the future, we plan on adding more functionalities for the user
        such as rating a book, reviewing it etc.

        In our quest to bring order to the book world, we realized how important and useful our project is because we spent a good amount of time
        to get the details of every book currently present in our database, finding news articles related to books, authors and so on. We feel
        this is one of the best ways to give back to the internet - making the others' jobs easier.

        Our website is still in its developmental phase, so there's still a lot of potential and a long way to go. But we would really appreciate it
        if you could spread the word. So go ahead, make the most of BOOKWIKI!!!

        If you have any queries or would like to give feedback, mail us at bookwikinotyetreal@hotmail.com or call us on +91 9XXXXXXXX9
